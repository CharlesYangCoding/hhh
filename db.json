delicious traditional dishes. One of them is known as \"zongzi\". We all like eating it very much.\nFirst of all, let's talk about how the zongzi is made. To make it, we need to prepare some reed leaves, glutinous rice, and other fillings. First, the glutinous rice should be soaked one night in advance before we wrap the zongzi. After the soaked glutinous rice is dried, we need to add an appropriate amount of red beans to the glutinous rice, stir it evenly, and then add some soy sauce, oyster sauce, and stir it evenly again. In this way, the zongzi will be more fragrant. Then, we should put the reed leaves into boiling water and boil them for about two minutes in order to make the leaves become soft and wrap the zongzi more easily. After all of that, you can start wrapping the zongzi. First, fold the reed leaves into a funnel shape. Then, add some fillings to the \"funnel\" and press it down tightly. At last, close the leaves and tie it up with beautiful threads. You can put it into the cold water and boil it. After all of that, you can only wait for a long time. I believe it will be delicious.\nSome people might ask that when we eat it. We eat it for a poet named Qu Yuan. The poet Qu Yuan had an immense love to his country. As the reason, he helped the king of Chu administer the country so that the country would be more strong. But after a few years, another country named Qin attacked his country and occupied his country. Qu Yuan was very sorrowful. So, on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, Qu Yuan threw himself into the Miluo River, and died for his country. The people didn't want the fish eat Qu Yuan. They threw the bamboo tube with rice into the river. After a long time, we always eat the zongzi on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.\nThe zongzi is very important in my home country. We eat it for commemorating Qu Yuan. We will never forget him. The food is not only delicious but also memorable. We like it very much forever.","source":"_posts/A popular Chinese traditional food——Zongzi.md","raw":"---\ntitle: A popular Chinese traditional food——Zongzi\ndate: 2024-01-14 11:00:19\ncategories: \n- English-composition\n- Tradition\n- Food\ntags: Food\n---\n![粽子](https://img0.baidu.com/it/u=734678289,3305521186&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG?w=500&h=375)\nIn our country, we have a lot of delicious traditional dishes.
